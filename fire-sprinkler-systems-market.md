<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Fire Sprinkler Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Wet Pipe Fire Sprinkler Systems</li><li>Dry Pipe Fire Sprinkler Systems</li><li>Deluge Fire Sprinkler Systems</li><li>Pre-Action Fire Sprinkler Systems</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Fire sprinkler systems are essential for fire protection and come in four main types. Wet pipe systems contain water under pressure, activating immediately when heat is detected. Dry pipe systems use pressurized air to keep pipes dry until a fire triggers them, making them suitable for cold environments. Deluge systems release large volumes of water simultaneously from open sprinklers, ideal for high-hazard areas. Pre-action systems combine features of both dry and wet systems, requiring a two-step activation for added safety.</p></p>
